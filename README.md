# Introduction
This is a building image processing algorithm from scratch project.

Also an implementation of a simple photoshop-like application for acnes and freckles removal.

You can checkout IMPS to see each algorithm.

Or you can play with main.py and main.exe to use the simple photoshop-like application.

Note that each implemetation is not optimized and in Python.
It is not fast.

# Methods
1. Mean
2. Gaussian Blur
3. Max
4. Min
5. Medium
6. Unsharp mean
7. Unsharp Gaussian
8. Histogram equalization
9. RGB color adjustment by hand
10. Pen Bush Interface

# Usage
1. Load Image from MyImage class and applying different algorithm on it.
2. Use main.exe to play around the Photoshop-like application
